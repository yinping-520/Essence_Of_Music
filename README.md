Once the profile is established, they will be presented with our Music Genre page, where they can select from our options of Pop, Country, Hip-Hop, etc.

One the user has selected the genre, they can select an artist, a song, or even a clip of the artist music video. If the User likes the song, click the "like" button to save the song into your My Playlist library. These songs will be saved for when the user logs back into the EOM page.
